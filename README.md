# KMean-Clustering-Project-ML
PROJECT TITLE: Analysis and prediction of "small_customer" of american mall market called as phonix mall .To find out how many customer are visited to a particular shop.On the basic of this prediction of annual income versus spending scores

# Desclaimer:
In this particular data sets we assume annual income as a centroid and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data node od the cluster.

# Problem statement:
The American finance market as per DGP of 2011 'phonix_trillums mall' As in the first range out of 5.The owner wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different kinds of clusters in entire mall

As a data science engineer predict the furturistic financial market for upcomming gdp rate based on no of clusters

the client wants atleast top 5 cluster (shops)

# Conclusion
According to the model basics prediction using machine learning alogrithm KMeans clustring we found that cluster-1 which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach more than data nodes.

# Reference
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clustration values.The yellow spots represents centroids which is max to max only 3
